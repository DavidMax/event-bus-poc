# Event Bus POC
- This is an experimental proof of concept that I'm building to help understand how event brokers work in the context of microservices.
- This very simple implementation uses Node.js and Express to create an event broker/bus that simply receives events and publishes them to listeners, which in this case, are microservices.
## Client
- Uses React for a very simple blog style front end with posts and comments, etc.
